This is the blog place where I will put my notes, experiences, thoughts about software development in general. Sometimes when I found a really good library or resources, I tend to forget about it after a while. Sometimes, it's quicker to dig into my blog (a.k.a my notebook) than to search online. Hopefully I develop a habit of writing blogs and keep knowledge organized. :)
